        </p>
        <p class="text">CS50 is harvard's introductory course to computer science. It covers the basics while also teaching you both C AND Python. It does offer assignments to do and they're relatively hard but doable. It consists of 14 2-hour long high-quality lectures covering all sorts of topics a beginner would want to know. Highly recommended as an introduction to this amazing field!</p>

            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">Odin Project</a>
        </p>
        <p class="text">The Odin Project is an open-source project aimed to be a beginner's friendly guide from 0 to a full-stack web developer. It consists of 2 main courses, Foundations & Full Stack. Foundations covers stuff like HTML, CSS, git, Linux, and how to use the terminal, while Full Stack has 2 versions.. Javascript(which is covered to the basics in Foundations anyway) or Ruby on Rails. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the field of web development! I even used what I learned to make this website from scratch!</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text">The Elements Of Computing Systems is a book aiming to teach a field of computer science a lot of people forget about: Computer Architechture. It teaches you about the extreme basics of how a computer works so you can appreciate the bigger picture, while also acting as a step-by-step guide to making your own computer from scratch! Then make it run Tetris! And the best part? 100% Free. No hardware required besides your own PC/Laptop, some software from their webside (Nand2Tetris), and some patience.</p>
